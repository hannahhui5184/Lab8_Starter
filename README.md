# Lab 8 - Starter
Hannah Hui
1. I would 1) put my automated tests in a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This way we can have a tighter screen on what gets pushed to our repo (we can prevent any code that fails tests from being pushed and merged). Making it automated throughout saves time and runs the most frequently out of all the options. Although ideally, I would want to have both 2) and 1) in my project's process.
2. No, I would use a unit test to check that.
3. No, because message would require many steps (input, verification, sending, receiving, display) that is beyond the scope of unit testing and more suited for end-to-end testing. This would be a large moving feature.
4. Yes, because this test is small scale and suited for one function's worth of implementation. It interacts with one component.
